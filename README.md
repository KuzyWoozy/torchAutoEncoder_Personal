# pyTorch AutoEncoder

## Installation:
  ```bash
  pip install torch
  pip install torchvision
  pip install matplotlib
  ```

## Usage:
  train.py = Train AEs
  evaluate.py = Evaluate reconstructed images

  > Edit train.py to change training configs, such as epochs and batch size
  > Modify src/AutoEncoder.py to change the AE itself
  > Evaluate saved models via evaulate.py. First image is original, 
    following image is reconstruction
